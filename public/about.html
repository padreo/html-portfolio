    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Chimezie Aniakor</strong>, a passionate and driven individual based in the UK with roots in Nigeria's vibrant Igbo culture. I'm currently developing my skills in full stack web development and forex trading, balancing both around a demanding rotating work schedule.</p>

<p>With a strong interest in technology and community-building, I'm building NaijaConnect UK â€” a platform designed to connect and empower Nigerians living in the UK. My goal is to merge tech with purpose, creating solutions that serve real people and real needs.</p>

<p>I'm naturally curious, highly organized, and motivated by growth. Whether I'm learning a new programming language, fine-tuning a trading strategy, or planning a new feature for my app, I approach every goal with focus and consistency.</p>
